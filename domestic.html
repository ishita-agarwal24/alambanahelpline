        <h1 class="sub-heading">WAYS TO COPE UP WITH DOMESTIC ABUSE</h1><br><br>
       
           <h2>1. Talk to a Therapist</h2>
           <p> Working with a therapist is often an important part of successfully managing depression. 
            "Psychotherapy will focus on helping people adjust their lifestyle in ways that are possible, 
            minimize their stress, and cope with stressors," says Dr. Nelson. 
            Among the issues that you can address together are how to improve your self-esteem, switch from negative to positive thinking, 
            and practice stress management.</p><br>
    
    
            <h2>2. Express Yourself in Writing</h2>
            <p>Writing in a journal is great therapy and can help you manage depression. You can relieve stress by being open about your thoughts, feelings, and concerns in your writing — and stress management is an important part of living well with depression. Be totally honest in your private journal. Writing down your feelings and challenges with depression can release pent-up emotions. You'll be amazed at how much better you feel after putting pen to paper for just a few minutes each day.
            </p><br>
    
    
            <h2>3. Boost Your Self-Image</h2>
            <p>People with depression often experience low self-esteem, so finding ways to feel better about yourself is an important aspect of treatment. Practice positive thinking by focusing your thoughts on your best qualities. You can also make lifestyle changes that can improve your self-esteem, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and spending time with friends who make you feel good about who you are.</p><br>
            
            
            <h2>4. Stick to a Schedule</h2>
            <p>Maintaining a healthy and regular routine is very helpful for people with depression, says Nelson. "Many times with depression, people's motivation drops," he explains, making them feel unproductive and fueling feelings of low self-esteem. Schedule an activity that you have to do every day — make it one you really enjoy — and aim for as much balance as possible in your life.</p>
